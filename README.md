# albumServer
Java web application for managing photos and videos.  This creates thumbnails of images 
and videos (by spawning Linux commands) and has simple searching and metadata.

This is an old code I wrote back in the 2000s to manage local stores of photos.  Every
once in a while I need to go back and figure something out (like how I managed passwords),
and I can never find the source.
